### Hi there ✨ 

I'm Delilah - gamedev 🎮 and software developer. VR is my soft spot. Most of my projects are private (sorry) or commercial (not here).
 
I like (statically) typed languages and particle systems. My tool of choice for creating interactive experiences is, at the moment, Unity. 

Currently obsessed with plants, cats, pizza and shaders 🌐✨.


[Here](https://github.com/delilah/bites 'Portfolio') you can find some of my favourite projects. Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/delilah 'LinkedIn')  💻
